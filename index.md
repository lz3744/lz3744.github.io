## About me
Hello! My name is Lucy Zhang. I attended North Rose-Wolcott Highschool, a small school located in Wolcott, NY.
I'm an introvert so I enjoy hobbies like building lego sets, playing videogames, painting, etc. Basically 
activities that are relaxing and peaceful! 

My favorite food is chicken alfredo!
